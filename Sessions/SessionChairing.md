Chairing a Session
==========================

1. Checking the speaker is set up with Audio Visual requirements.
2. Introducing the speaker or speakers to the Audience
3. Monitoring time  - giving them 5 minute warnings. (The easiest way is just to put your hands up )
4. managing Questions and Answers
5. Thanking the speaker
6. Prompting the crowd to applaud and clap.

#### Remarks

When things are well prepared it is an easy job. 
The interesting stuff is about checking all the AV stuff.
